# React-Native-Uni-Project
Here you can find my first React Native uni project: a food delivery cross-platform mobile application

Project Overview
The application retrieves and displays data such as images and menu descriptions from a server. To achieve this, I consulted the server API's documentation and used it to handle data retrieval.

The app is composed of four main pages:

Profile Page: Displays user information.
Menu Overview Page: Lists all the menus available for customers to browse.
Menu Detail Page: Shows detailed information about a selected menu.
Map Page: Displays the delivery location, customer location, and driver location on a map.

Key Highlights
The project involved decisions based on the professor's guidelines, with some enhancements introduced by me.

This experience allowed me to gain knowledge and hands-on practice in:

Imperative web programming paradigms
Event-based programming
MVVM architectural paradigm
Handling location services and permissions
Working extensively with APIs (e.g., handling HTTP requests)
Managing application state, props, hooks, and JSX syntax
